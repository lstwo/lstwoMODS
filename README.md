# Building Yourself

If you want to get the latest and most unfinished features you can try to build it yourself.

1. Clone the repository
2. Open it in Visual Studio (or any other IDE / compiler)
3. Build the Project
4. Copy the lstwoMODS.dll from `<Project Folder>/bin/Debug/net46/` to `<Game Folder>/BepInEx/plugins/`

# FAQ

- **Does it have a server player count changer?**

  No, just use [Larger Lobbies](https://www.nexusmods.com/wobblylife/mods/8) for that.

- **Why did you change the name? (No one actually asked that)**

  Because "Not Azzamods" is very confusing at times.
